TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I was able to broaden my knowledgge in python especially being able to do for loops and if statements. I still have difficulty in terms of understanding python syntax but some things are easily searched up on. However the last exercise to generate a pyramid was damn too hard yo. But drawing from maths and using the absolute function has broaden my view in terms of being able to problem solve. This expanded the amount of resources and knowledge i must use in order to problem solve.
