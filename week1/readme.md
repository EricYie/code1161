TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I learned how to develop a dev environment however everything is still new to me as this platform is very unique looking and not use to it. So currently feeling abit uncomfrotable but I'm sure overtime I will have confidence in terms of operating vscode.
