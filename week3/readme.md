TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week was alot more difficult especially the concept of try and except. In previous program languages such as MATLAB and VBA, I learnt about if, for and while statements however, I have not learned about this try and except which was harder to implement. The concept of except as Exception e is still abit unclear. However, I am getting more comfortable in terms of pushing and pulling to upstream/origin to submit work. I am also getting more familiar of how python's terminal and debugging console works. More so, I am slowly understanding the potential of python and how it will be more powerful than excel.
